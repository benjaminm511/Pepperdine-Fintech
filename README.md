Kraken also has plans to raise new funding that would value the exchange over 10 Billion Dollars potentially surpassing 20 Billion.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  - As someone who is a user of Kraken Exchange, I have very little critics for the exchange. It was very easy to use to me as an avid crypto currency trader and they provide a very clean interface that is easy to navigate through. One service that I would like to see on Kraken is an earn crypto program similarly to Coinbase's earn program. Coinbase allows user to earn small amounts of crypto by watching tuturiols and answering questions on their exchange. 

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
 - Implementing an earn program could bring many new users to their exchange. Crypto Currency is a relatively new technology that many people are not educated about. A feature like this educates new users while also rewarding them for learning.  This opens up new opportunities for people to learn about blockchain technology. With a feature like this, anyone with a smartphone in a supported country would be able to earn crypto while they learn about crypto. This means millions more people now have a trusted, safe, and legal bridge to the cryptoeconomy — even if they don’t have a credit card or bank account with which to buy cryptocurrency.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  - This product is taken from the idea that instead of earning crypto currencies through mining, which many people dont have the tools to do, users can earn crypto by learning. Kraken would need to own enough of the crypto currencies to be able to distribute it through this program. For example Coinbase has used more than [100 Million USD](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-earn-now-allows-users-in-100-countries-to-earn-their-share-of-100m-in-cryptocurrency-6eb80d645191) funding their own program. Kraken should consider this as an investment as it would bring new users to their exchange

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  - Many people believe blockchain technologies and crypto currencies are going to lead the financial industry in the future. Educating new users about these technologies is crucial for mass adoption. Kraken encouraging features like an earn program coould help lead new users into the market
