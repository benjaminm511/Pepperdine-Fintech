# Pepperdine-Fintech
My name is Ben, I am 2O years old and I am a student. I grew up in ministry and I currently work partime at a homeless outreach organization at SWAG ( Social Work Action Group)

My career goals is to become a financial advisor in the crypto currency sector

I chose Fintech because I believe the financial sector will revolve around technology
